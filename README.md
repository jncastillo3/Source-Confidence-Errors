# Source-Confidence-Errors
Analysis files for high confidence source errors utilizing behavioral data

*incomplete repository

Contains preprocessing files and code to analyze behavioral data from a recognition memory task using a bayesian hierarchhical model. Preprocessing requires a total count of all high and low confidence source errors across varying levels of encoding strength for multiple datasets. A total of 12 datasets (utilizing similar task paradigms) were used in the analysis here. Running the 'DataFormat' script yeild csv files with source error counts for each subject, across each experiment, and each level of encoding strength. 

A Baysian Model is then used to determine how predictive item confidence can be of a source error across datasets, and levels of item confidence.
